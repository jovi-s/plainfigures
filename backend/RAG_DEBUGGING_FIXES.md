# RAG System Debugging Fixes

## Problem Identified
The LangGraph RAG system was returning the error: **"No relevant docs were retrieved using the relevance score threshold 0.7"**

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Threshold Too High**: The default similarity threshold of 0.7 was too restrictive
2. **Incorrect Scoring Method**: Used `similarity_search_with_relevance_scores` which had issues with LangChain FAISS
3. **Distance vs Similarity**: FAISS returns distance scores (lower = better), but we needed similarity scores (higher = better)

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Similarity Scoring in Base Tool (`base_tool.py`)

**Before:**
```python
results = self.vector_store.similarity_search_with_relevance_scores(
    query, k=k, score_threshold=score_threshold
)
```

**After:**
```python
# Get raw distance scores
all_results = self.vector_store.similarity_search_with_score(query, k=k*2)

# Convert distance to similarity: similarity = 1 / (1 + distance)  
results = []
for doc, distance in all_results:
    similarity = 1 / (1 + distance) if distance >= 0 else 1.0
    if similarity >= score_threshold:
        results.append((doc, similarity))
```

### 2. Lowered Default Threshold

**Before:**
```python
similarity_threshold: float = Field(default=0.7, description="Minimum similarity score")
```

**After:**
```python
similarity_threshold: float = Field(default=0.3, description="Minimum similarity score")
```

### 3. Added Debug Logging

Added comprehensive logging to track:
- Raw similarity scores from FAISS
- Number of results found above threshold
- Content previews of retrieved documents
- Tool execution details

### 4. Updated All Tool Search Methods

Modified CSV, SQL, and Document tools to:
- Accept `score_threshold` parameter
- Pass threshold to base search method
- Maintain backward compatibility

### 5. Graph Integration

Updated the main graph to:
- Pass configuration threshold to tools
- Log detailed execution information
- Show which tools are being called and results

## Files Modified

1. `src/agent/rag_system/tools/base_tool.py` - Core FAISS search fix
2. `src/agent/rag_system/configuration.py` - Lower default threshold
3. `src/agent/rag_system/tools/csv_tool.py` - Accept threshold parameter
4. `src/agent/rag_system/tools/sql_tool.py` - Accept threshold parameter  
5. `src/agent/rag_system/tools/document_tool.py` - Accept threshold parameter
6. `src/agent/rag_system/graph.py` - Enhanced logging and threshold passing

## Testing Approach

Created debugging scripts:
- `debug_rag_flow.py` - Comprehensive testing of all components
- `simple_tool_test.py` - Minimal test for individual tools

## Expected Results

With these fixes:
1. **Threshold Issues Resolved**: Lower threshold (0.3) should return results
2. **Proper Scoring**: Distance correctly converted to similarity scores
3. **Better Debugging**: Detailed logs show exactly what's happening
4. **Flexible Configuration**: Threshold can be adjusted per query

## Verification Steps

To test the fixes:

1. **Check Data Availability**: Verify CSV, database, and document files exist
2. **Test Individual Tools**: Run tools separately to isolate issues
3. **Monitor Logs**: Check debug output for similarity scores and result counts
4. **End-to-End Test**: Run full RAG queries with different thresholds

## Key Learnings

1. **LangChain FAISS Gotcha**: `similarity_search_with_relevance_scores` doesn't work as expected
2. **Distance vs Similarity**: Always convert FAISS distance to similarity for thresholding
3. **Threshold Tuning**: Start with lower thresholds (0.1-0.3) and adjust based on results
4. **Debug Early**: Comprehensive logging saves debugging time

## Next Steps

1. Test the fixes with actual queries
2. Monitor performance and adjust thresholds as needed
3. Consider adding adaptive thresholding based on query results
4. Implement result quality metrics for further optimization
